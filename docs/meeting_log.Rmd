# 16 July 2021

## Attendees

* Ewan Birney
* Aylwyn Scally
* Ian Brettell

## Notes

* Viral load: what is it? 
  - Suppression of low $F_{ST}$.
  - [ACTION]{color = "red"} Studies done in Africa?
* Expectations re: curve
  - Take same number of post-clumped SNPs from height as there are for pigmentation, but ranked by p-value. Does it skew in the same way?
  - Makes sense that stronger SNPs would have a flatter eCDF because they would be adaptive in all environments.
* [ACTION]{color="red"} Add Covid to analysis. Ewan to find SNPs from latest GWAS.
* [ACTION]{color="red"} Ian to set up Google Doc for manuscript.
